## Project Overview

**AI-Tutor-Multi-Agent-System** is an intelligent multi-agent AI tutoring platform designed to provide subject-specific educational assistance. It leverages multiple specialized AI agents, each trained or configured for different academic subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and more.

The system uses the CAMEL Core framework combined with powerful Mistral language models to generate accurate, context-aware responses. User queries are automatically classified by subject and routed to the appropriate AI tutor agent, creating an interactive and personalized learning experience.

The frontend interface is built with Streamlit for a clean, user-friendly experience accessible through a web browser.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Multiple specialized AI agents handle different subjects.
- **Automatic Subject Classification:** Queries are automatically routed to the relevant subject agent.
- **Mistral API Integration:** Direct usage of Mistral language models for response generation.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Supports conversational interactions with AI tutors.
- **Streamlit Web Interface:** Responsive and easy-to-use frontend.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Easily add new subject agents or improve existing ones.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Modern UI with dark theme styling.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Mistral API key 

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tushar80rt/AI-Tutor-Multi-Agent-System.git
cd AI-Tutor-Multi-Agent-System

Create and Activate Virtual Environment

Windows:

bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

Linux/macOS:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named api.env in the root directory and add your Mistral API credentials:

MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here

Replace your_mistral_api_key_here with your actual API key.

Run the Streamlit Application
streamlit run app.py

The app will start and open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.


-> How the System Works

User Query Input: Users enter their academic questions via the Streamlit frontend.

Subject Classification: The input query is analyzed by a subject classifier to determine the most relevant subject area (e.g., Physics, Chemistry).

Agent Routing: Based on the classification, the query is routed to the appropriate subject-specific AI tutor agent.

Mistral API Request: The AI tutor agent formulates a prompt and sends it to the Mistral language model API for generating a detailed, accurate response.

Response Display: The generated response is received and displayed back in the Streamlit chat interface for the user.

Interactive Session: The user can ask follow-up questions or switch topics seamlessly.


-> Usage Instructions

Open the Streamlit app in your browser.

Enter any academic question in the input field.

The system will detect the subject and forward the question to the relevant AI tutor.

Receive a well-structured answer generated by the Mistral model.



:-
You can continue the conversation or ask new questions anytime.
